    <h1>My School</h1>
    <p>
        <b>BGKV</b> is our <mark>school</mark>, it is situated in Kolkata, Saltlake. A School is a place where we learn and grow, not just academically, but also socially and emotionally. It's a platform
        where we meet new people, make friends, and develop important life skills like teamwork, communication, and
        problem-solving. Our teachers guide us, support us, and inspire us to become better versions of ourselves. From the
        classroom to the playground, school is a place where we create memories, face challenges, and discover our passions. As
        we navigate through the ups and downs of school life, we learn valuable lessons that stay with us for the
        rest of our lives.
